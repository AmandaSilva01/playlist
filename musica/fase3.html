            I do the same thing, I told you that I never would <br>
            I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could <br>
            I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you <br>
            I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey 
        </p>
          <br>

                I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still <br> 
                I realize the time that I wasted here <br>
                I feel like you can't feel the way I feel <br>
                I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here
            </p>

                It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh-ooh) <br>
                And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up <br>
                Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded <br>
                'Cause you ain't never left me empty-handed <br>
