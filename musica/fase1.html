            For all the times that you rained on my parade <br>
            And all the clubs you get in using my name <br>
            You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake <br>
            You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't
    </p>
      <br>
        <p>
            And I didn't wanna write a song <br>
            'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but <br>
            You still hit my phone up <br>
            And baby, I'll be movin' on <br>
            And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back <br>
            Maybe you should know that
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My mama don't like you and she likes everyone <br>
            And I never like to admit that I was wrong <br>
            And I've been so caught up in my job <br>
            Didn't see what's going on, but now I know <br>
            I'm better sleeping on my own
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br>
            Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself <br>
            And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' <br>
            You should go and love yourself
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But when you told me that you hated my friends <br>
            The only problem was with you and not them <br>
            And every time you told me my opinion was wrong <br>
            And tried to make me forget where I came from
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And I didn't wanna write a song <br>
            'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but <br>
            You still hit my phone up <br>
            And baby, I'll be movin' on <br>

        <br>
        <p>
            For all the times that you made me feel small <br>
            I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all <br>
            I never felt so low and I was vulnerable <br>
            Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

            'Cause if you like the way you look that much <br>
            Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah) <br>
            And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm) <br>
            Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no) <br>
            You should go and love yourself
